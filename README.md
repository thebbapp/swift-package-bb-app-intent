# ``BbAppIntent``

Navigation and intent management system.

## Overview

The BbAppIntent library provides a comprehensive navigation and intent system for the application. It includes the observable ``BbAppIntentCoordinator`` class that manages navigation state, the ``BbAppIntentDestination`` and ``BbAppIntentSheet`` base classes for type-safe navigation, loader registration for async destination preparation, renderer registration for view presentation, and URL routing capabilities. This system enables declarative navigation with full async/await support and type safety.
